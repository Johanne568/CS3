						<li>Pet owners: Pre-identify shelters, a pet-friendly hotel, or an out-of-town friend or relative where you can take your pets in an evacuation.  
						<div>Local animal shelters may be able to offer advice on what to do with your pets if you are asked to evacuate your home.</div></li>
					</ul>
