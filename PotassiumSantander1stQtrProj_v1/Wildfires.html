			<h2>Before</h2>
			<ol> 
				<li>Make an Emergency Plan</li> 
					<ul> 
						<li>Make sure everyone in your household knows and understands what to do if you need to quickly evacuate.  </li>
					</ul> 
				<li>Strengthen your Home</li> 
					<ul>  
						<li>Use fire-resistant materials to build, renovate or make repairs.</li>
						<li>Find an outdoor water source with a hose that can reach any area of your property.</li>
						<li>Create a fire-resistant zone that is free of leaves, debris or flammable materials for at least 30 feet from your home.</li> 
						<li>Designate a room that can be closed off from outside air. Close all doors and windows. Set up a portable air cleaner to keep indoor pollution levels low when smoky conditions exist.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Know your Evacuation Zone</li> 
					<ul>  
						<li>You may have to evacuate quickly due to a wildfire. Learn your evacuation routes, practice with household, pets and identify where you will go.</li>
						<li>Follow the instructions from local authorities. They will provide the latest recommendations based on the threat to your community and appropriate safety measures.</li>
					</ul>  
				<li>Gather Supplies</li> 
					<ul>  
						<li>Have enough supplies for your household, including a first aid kit, in your go bag or car trunk.</li>
						<li>Be cautious when carrying flammable or combustible household products that can cause fires or explosions if handled wrong, such as aerosols, cooking oils, rubbing alcohol and hand sanitizer.</li>
						<li>If available, store an N95 mask to protect yourself from smoke inhalation.</li> 
						<li>Keep your cell phone charged when wildfires could be in your area. Purchase backup charging devices to power electronics.</li>
					</ul>

			<h2>During</h2> 
			<p><div>Pay attention to emergency alerts and notifications for information and instructions.</div> 
			<div>Evacuate immediately if authorities tell you to do so!</div>
			<div>If trapped, call 9-1-1 and give your location, but be aware that emergency response could be delayed or impossible. Turn on lights to help rescuers find you.</div>
			<div>If you are sick and need medical attention, contact your healthcare provider for further care instructions and shelter in place, if possible.</div>
			<p> 
		</div> 
		<div>  
			<h2>After</h2> 
			<p><div>Do not return home until authorities say it is safe to do so.</div>
			<div>Avoid hot ash, charred trees, smoldering debris and live embers. The ground may contain heat pockets that can burn you or spark another fire.</div>
			<div>When cleaning, wear protective clothing – including a long-sleeved shirt, long pants, work gloves and sturdy thick-soled shoes – during clean-up efforts. </div>
			<div>Send text messages or use social media to reach out to family and friends. Phone systems are often busy following a disaster. Make calls only in emergencies.</div>
