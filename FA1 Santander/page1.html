			<li>Groudon is a Ground-type Legendary Pokémon introduced in Generation III</li> 
			<li>Groudon is a massive, bipedal, dinosaur-like Pokémon covered in red, segmented plates of thick skin that act as armor. It has a gray underside and large white spikes that run along the sides of its head, body, and tail. Groudon has four claws on each hand, four dozer-like blades on the end of its large tail, and three claws on each foot with gray markings under its feet. It also has blue stripes inside the seams of its armor plating which can only be seen when Groudon is glowing with power.</li>
			<li>Groudon is an immensely powerful Pokémon, having the ability to summon intense droughts and cause volcanic eruptions. The droughts it can cause allow it to evaporate water, while the volcanic eruptions it can summon enable it to create land. If it encounters its rival, Kyogre, they will engage in a cataclysmic battle.</li>
			<li>Groudon sleeps underground in large magma chambers.</li>
